## Overview

This project is for you to use as a starting point for deploying Waypoint into your AWS environment. Use the template button to get a copy of the project into your own GitHub namespace. Start making changes to the configuration files to get HashiCorp Waypoint up and running for your downstream consumers.

An overview of the project can be found in this blog [article](https://cardenas88karl.medium.com/deploying-hashicorpwaypoint-as-a-shared-service-207b35927431)

**IMPORTANT**: THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL HASHICORP PROJECT.

</p>

## Products

The following products are utilized in this project.

* [HashiCorp Packer](https://www.packer.io/)
* [HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
* [HashiCorp Waypoint](https://www.waypointproject.io/)
* [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?ec2-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&ec2-whats-new.sort-order=desc)
* [AWS SSM Plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)

## Requirements

* An AWS account
* AWS credentials and permissions to deploy AWS resources. Please see the [Terraform README](./terraform/README.md) for a list of all AWS resources deployed.
* A custom domain and hosted zone is needed. Without a valid TLS certificate AWS load balancers are unable to handle gRPC traffic.
* An AWS VPC
* Waypoint CLI Installed. See the install [tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/waypoint/get-started-install) for help.


## Getting Started

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the project to your own GitHub namespace. 

### Create the Waypoint AMIs

You will create two AMIs through HashiCorp Packer. The AMIs are sourced from the latest version of the Amazon Linux2 AMI. 

Next, create a file inside the folder `packer/server` directory and name it `variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl`. See the file `pkrvars.example` as a starting point. Populate the variables with values values that corresponds to your compute environment. The content of the file should look similar to the example snippet below. Ensure you specify the AWS profile to use for the Packer build.

```tf
profile          = "myRole"
spot-instances   = ["t2.micro"]
role_arn         = "arn:aws:iam::00000000000000:role/myPackerRole"
instance-profile = "myAwesomeInstanceProfile"
description      = "An AMI sourced from Linux2 that hosts a Waypoint server"
public-ip        = true
tags = {
  environment = "test"
  packer      = "true"
}
```

Once you have created the two required files, `variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl`, and `terraform.tfvars`, you may begin to create the AMI. Go ahead and issue the command `packer init && packer build .` to start the AMI build process.  This will initialize Packer and download the required plugins, as well as trigger the AMI build process. This may take up to 10 min depending on the EC2 instance size selected.

Do the same steps for the `packer/runner` directory. 

Once the two AMIs are created by Packer, navigate back to the root of the project, `cd ../../`

### Deploy Waypoint

 The Terraform code takes advantage of existing Terraform modules in the Terraform Public Module Registry. The module for the [Autoscaling group](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/autoscaling/aws/latest), and the [Network Load Balancer](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/alb/aws/latest) are both from the public Terraform module registry. 

As mentioned previously, feel free to create more variables and customize the template as needed. 

1. Navigate to the `terraform/` folder.
1. Create a file named `terraform.tfvars`, and populate the values for all the required variables. See the [requirements section](./terraform/README.md) below to identify required inputs. Use the file `tfvars.example` as a starting point. 
1. Issue the command `terraform init`. This will initialize Terraform.
1. Issue the command `terraform plan`. This will generate a preview of the infrastructure that will be created. Verify everything looks as expected.
1. If everything looks good in the Terraform plan output, then go ahead and issue the command `terraform apply -auto-approve`. Wait for all resources to come up. This may take about 5 min, depending on the instance sizes selected.
1. Go to the Waypoint UI and ensure the domain resolves through DNS. The URL is provided as a Terraform output. It may take a few minutes for DNS to resolve correctly. See the [Accessing Waypoint](#accessing-waypoint) section for more details.
1. Go to the AWS SSM Parameter store and retrive the Waypoint token. The token is stored in the parameter named `waypoint-context`.
1.Go back to the Waypoint UI and login with the Waypoint token.
1. Configure your local environment for Waypoint. See [Local Workstation Configuration](#local-workstation-configuration) for more guidance.
1. At this point, you may now start using Waypoint for application deployments ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰

## Automate the AMI build
You can have Terraform trigger the Packer build job, if that is the desired behavior. Uncomment the following code snippet that is found inside of the `main.tf`. There are two `null_resources` available, one for each AMI (server and runner).

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "build-waypoint-ami" {

   triggers = {
     run = timestamp()
   }

   provisioner "local-exec" {
     command = "cd packer_config/ && packer build ."

     environment = {
       AWS_PROFILE = "automation"
     }
   }
}
```

Feel free to adjust the trigger as needed. 
There are commented `depends_on` added to all resources that depends on this step to be completed prior.
Please review the Terraform [README.MD](./terraform/README.md) for more details. 

## Accessing Waypoint

The Terraform output will provide the URL for the Waypoint server and the application loadbalancer. In order to access the Waypoint UI you need the Waypoint context token. This token can be found in the AWS SSM Parameter store. In the AWS Paramater store, retrive the context token from the secret named `waypoint-context`. Next, go to the custom domain endpoint you provided the Terraform configuration, example `https://abc.deployment.com`. 

This will take you to the Waypoint UI authentication page. Provide the token so that you may log into the Waypoint server. After you have authenticated into Waypoint, you may now configure your workstation to interact with Waypoint.

### Local Workstation Configuration

In order to interact with the Waypoint server you must configure the Waypoint CLI with the proper context information. This information is provded by the Waypoint server in the UI. Click on the `CLI` button to get the proper information. 

 Note: The configuration provided by the Waypoint UI is missing the parameter flag `-server-tls-skip-verify=true`. Use the code snippet below and add your unique values to create a local Waypoint context.

```shell
waypoint context create \
    -server-addr=<yourDomainHere>:9701 \
    -server-auth-token=<YourTokenHere> \
    -server-require-auth=true \
    -server-tls-skip-verify=true \
    -set-default <yourDomainHere>
```

## Deploy a demo app

A forked version of the HashiCorp Waypoint [demo application](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples) can be found in the `demo/` folder. 
Go to the `demo/` folder. Issue the command `waypoint init` to initialize the project.
Once the project is initiliaze, issue the command `waypoint up -remote`. This will trigger the build, deploy, and release process. Upon completion, go to the application loadbalancer URL. The URL can be found in the Terraform outputs.

**NOTE**: It may take a few minutes for DNS to resolve.

## Known Issues

### AMI not found when using Terraform to trigger build.
If you encounter a message during the `terraform apply` step that the AMI is not found (see below).

```
 Error: Error creating Auto Scaling Group: ValidationError: You must use a valid fully-formed launch template. The image id '[ami-04c61f099db4b898d]' does not exist
â”‚ 	status code: 400, request id: a0fe9ccf-e8c1-4b29-bb90-59a7dc602a30
â”‚
â”‚   with module.asg.aws_autoscaling_group.this[0],
â”‚   on .terraform/modules/asg/main.tf line 310, in resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "this":
â”‚  310: resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "this" {

```
Ensure that the `depends_on` in the `data.tf` is uncommented.

### The Waypoit generated URL does not work?

This is an expected error. Please use the url of the application load balancer to access the deployed application.
The URL can be found in the terraform output.

### The command `waypoint destroy -auto-approve` does not remove the project and the deployed application
This is flaw at the moment. In order to clean up you must remote into the runner (AWS Remote Session Manager) and remove the Docker container. Alternatively, you could terminate the runner instance. The auto-scaling group will ensure another runner instance comes up.  The project will also linger in the Waypoint UI. [GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/1934)
